                    <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2023 by <a>Esteban</a></p>

                    <p>This blog post will be about the progress on trying to retro fit a current Honda generation cluster into a 1998 Honda Civic.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I got my 1998 Honda Civic in 2016, I've always wanted a car that would drive from point A to point B with no issues. My civic has been capable of driving all up and down California. As the years passed of driving an older car and seeing newer cars with new tech features, I’ve always asked myself how can I implement that into my car.   
                     </p>

                        <p>In 2020 at the Tokyo Auto Salon show, Honda’s brand “Modulo” unveiled a concept car modeled on a 1997 Honda Civic Hatchback EK. The concept was named “the Civic Cyber Night Japan Cruiser 2020”. It was an attempt to present the EK as a modern car with a type of flair to make it seem futuristic. In doing this project, Modulo had borrowed different parts from the whole current Gen Honda line.
                        </p>

                        <p>In doing this project, Modulo had borrowed different parts from the whole current Gen Honda line.They borrowed rims from a Honda Insight and they used mirrors from a Honda S660. They also used a cluster from a S660. When I saw how modern and slick the cluster looked in that civic, I immediately wanted to own one and use it for my car. 

                            </p>
                            <img src="Blog 2.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

                            <p>After months of contemplating about truly taking on this project, I decided to pull the trigger on purchasing one. With my previous business ventures, I was able to source a 2016 Honda S660 Cluster from Japan’s Yahoo Auction Sites. 
                            </p>
                                <img src="Blog 3.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

                                <p>There’s no information online how Modulo was able to retro fit this cluster in their EK project. With the photos that are online, they show that its powered on and has a custom layout for the “Cyber Night” theme. I believe that not all functions on the cluster displayed are functional since this was just a concept car, but I want my cluster to be 100% functional.

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Analog signal clusters used to come in all Pre-2000’s Honda cars. As Civic’s and Accord’s were not targeted to be a luxury cars, but targeted for commuters and first time car buyers. So features like digital clusters were not an idea Honda had in mind at the time. Honda’s focus was on reliability and cost effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <p>So, for analog signal clusters, they have magnetic gauges to display information. 

                    </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Speed</li>
                            <li>RPM's</li>
                            <li>Fuel</li>
                            <li>Tempuraute</li>
                        </ul>

                    </p> 

                    <p>The way that analog signals work is that they work in waves of frequency much like a type of radio signal. In contrast, unlike modern clusters, they work off of digital inputs which are bits and bytes ex: 0’s and 1’s. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Since I knew I had to overcome this issue of translating Analog to Digital, I ordered myself a Arduino Nano to be the middle person. The Arduino has the capability of reading and writing Analog signals and also Digital signals for read and write.

                    </p>



                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>So, since the Honda S660 was never sold in America since its release, finding information was been proven difficult. This car overseas has not been sold in vast numbers like other Honda models. Therefore, the community behind the car is not very large. For example, there’s an international group on Facebook and there are only roughly around 3,000 members. The majority of sales for this car was in Japan.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>I knew that the cluster needed power + and ground, but I didn’t know what the pin layout was for this cluster. So, I started to look at other Honda clusters from the same year. I was able to find the electrical schematics and pin layouts for other cars but each car had their difference from each other. So, if I was to use the pin layout from a different car, it would be useless as the power and ground were in a different position.
                    </p>

                    <p>So, I started to look online for the S660 electrical schematics. After weeks of looking, all of my results pointed at a CD that was an OEM Honda dealership repair guide. Now this CD was apparently hard to get. According to other S660 owners, they are discontinued, not a lot of them were sold, and the ones that were being sold were in auction sites that rarely get posted for sale. Once a person obtains the CD, they would run into compatibility issues due to the CD only working properly on windows vista and windows 7. So, getting the CD was out of the question. 
 
                    </p>
                    <img src="Blog 4.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">

                    <p>When I was looking online, I did all my research in English, but I started to search in Japanese which resulted in different results. I was able to find an Automotive repair website that had the schematics for the S660, but also other Japan domestic cars.

                    </p>
                    <p>The schematics resulted in the same power and ground location as the 2016 Honda Civic. So, I started to disassemble my cluster console to expose the plugs. According to the layout, it seemed that I only needed to get a 12v power for pin location 1 and ground for pin location 4. So, I probed power from pin C4 and ground from pin c13, but this resulted in nothing. With a multi meter, I checked for 12 volt current at the end of the plug-in, but it resulted in no power to the cluster.It seems that there needs to be more wires plugged in somewhere to power on the cluster. I suspect that IG1 pin needs to be powered as well. 
                        </p>
 
                        </p>
                        <img src="Blog 5 copy.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                        <p>
                            All in all, I will be purchasing a DC Power Supply Variable to create a test bench so that I don’t have to disassemble my car just to provide a 12v power. So, hopefully in part 2 of this series I will be able to power it on and then send signals to Can Bus signals.
